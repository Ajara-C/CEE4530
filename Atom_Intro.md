## Headers
Headers like the one above are made by using the # symbol. The more ## symbols that you use the smaller the font.
# Biggest
## Big
### small
#### smaller
###### smallest

Then to add text just type in the markdown file.
## Emphasis
In order to make something italics you can use the * or _ before and after _the_ *statement*

In order to make something **bold** you can use __two__ asterisks ** or __two__ underscores __ .

If you want to ~~strikethrough~~ something you can use two tildas ~~ before and after the statement.
## Lists
### Bullets
* In order to make a bullet you can use the asterisk *
- The dashed line also works (-)
+ as does the plus sign (+)
### Numbered Lists
1. First point
2. Second point

## Tables
| Tables     | are   | cool    |
| ---------- | ----- | ------- |
| fun things | go in | them    |
| like your  | lab   | reports |


Make sure that you have the Markdown Table Editor package. To start a table you use the vertical line. Type your column headers in between and hit enter. Then in preview a table should appear and use can use the table editor to make the rest of your table and make it look nice.
